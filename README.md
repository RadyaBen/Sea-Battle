## What is Sea Battle?

* This is a simple game created similar to a sea battle. 
* There is a 10x10 square in which the ship is located.  
* If there was a hit on the ship, then it will be shown. If not, then nothing will be shown.
* There is also a counter of moves, that is, how many moves were spent on sinking the ship.
* As soon as the ship is sunk, the game ends.
