Sea Battle is a simple game created similar to a sea battle. There is a 10x10 square in which the ship is located. If there was a hit on the ship, then it will be shown. If not, then nothing will be shown. There is also a counter of moves, that is, how many moves were spent on sinking the ship. As soon as the ship is sunk, the game ends.
